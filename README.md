# LazyLanger

LazyLanger is a tool to extract most common words from a subtitle, and sort them out by number of appearance in a show / movie subtitle. Useful when learning a new language, to get the most used words from a language.

## ToDo

- [x] Read a text file (subtitle) or multiple text files and merge into one file
- [x] Remove lines that start with numbers
- [x] Convert comma, dot, ? and ! into spaces
- [x] Split all words by space
- [x] Sort words by number of occurance
- [x] Return JSON containing list of words and number of occurance
- [ ] Reject single character words <-- I'm too lazy at the moment for this one
- [ ] Create UI, a form with upload field, nothing special
- [ ] Display result in a table after sorting
- [ ] Create CSV file of that table on demand (button to create a file)
- [ ] Make each word start with a capital letter
